		<div class="caption"> When people ask me what is my influence, what are my influences, the first two that I mention are Geia, meaning "the earth" and my mother. Now the earth sounds that I experienced in my childhood were really dense and beautiful canopies of sound that came from all of the insects, birds and animals around. I lived in Houston, Texas. I was born in 1932 and grew up at a time when humans had less impact on the environment than they do today. I mean, now the frogs are leaving and vanishing. The frogs in my childhood could be heard loud and clear. Then of course, now so much is paved over with asphalt and cement that the cicadas are trapped and can't get out. But you can still hear wonderful stereophonic cicada sounds in Houston as you walk or drive down the street.</div>

	<div class="info timeperspectives"> 
		<div class="caption"> Then in 1953, I got a tape recorder for the first time. That was when tape recorders became available on the home market. And I began to record noises from my apartment window. I recorded a lot of different kinds of things, and then in 1959 I got started making a tape piece. This first tape piece was called "Time Perspectives", and it was composed of four channels, using two stereo machines.</div>

	<div class="info oneoffour"> 
		<div class="caption"> My interest was always in live performance, and I started to find out ways to use tape recorders and perform live with them. I began to use oscillators; this is what my electronic music was. I used oscillators tuned to high frequencies above hearing that would produce difference tones-- the difference between any two frequencies would be audible in this system. I used only, in the first pieces, 2 or 3 oscillators to start with, but the beat frequencies or difference tones and the bias frequencies of the tape recorders, the tape heads themselves, were generated between those oscillators. So I created a system that was quite unstable, but very interesting, and I could use it to create a vast variety of sounds. Later, I was at the University of Toronto for a summer with a bank of twelve oscillators that I could key or turn on from a keyboard and then play with the dials. I made "One of Four" there, which is a kind of classic electronic piece using that method.</div>

	<div class="info alienbog"> 
		<div class="caption"> "Alien Bog" I made at Mills in 1967, in the summer. This was the summer before I left for UCSD. The studio window opened out onto the pond right there on the campus--beautiful pond, it's still there, and it had a lots of interesting sounds coming out of it. I would listen to those sounds as I was making my music, and I made a whole series of pieces that had the word "bog" in the title. "Alien Bog" was the one that got on the Pogus CD, and I guess I felt that the sounds in "Alien Bog" were alien to the pond. That's how the title came about. I used the same delay system that I'm still using now for "Alien Bog" with the Buchla box at the same time.</div>
