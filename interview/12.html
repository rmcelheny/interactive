		Your lease ends in 2019. Do you have any goals for the first 5 years of American Medium?
		<p class="travis">
		It's hard to say. Iwould say that my goal is to continue to expand our programming. To get more artists on the roster. We'd like to be more invigorated with one-night programing as well. Finishing the physical build-out of the backyard and basement, and make the building really special, that's a major goal. But those are all do-able, forseeable goals.

		<p class="travis">
		A big goal is to have the gallery function as our main jobs, we all work elsewhere right now. We'd like to be doing well enough to bring in a fuller staff. A curatorial assistant and a registrar. Somebody to help with research. 
		</p>
		<p class="travis">
		But the physical space is important to all of us. Providing a sanctuary. wanting the backyard to be some sort of breather kind of space, space to reflect.
