	Time Perspectives<br><br>1959<br><br>
	As said in a 2003 public radio interview:<br><br>
	<div class="pauline">In 1953 I got a tape recorder for the first time. That was when tape recorders became available on the home market. And I began to record noises from my apartment window. I recorded a lot of different kinds of things, and then in 1959 I got started making a tape piece. This first tape piece was called "Time Perspectives", and it was composed of four channels, using two stereo machines. So it was really through owning a tape recorder and then beginning to work with it creatively, recording sounds… well, recording them at 7.5 and dropping them to 3.75 or vice versa, that I got started working seriously with tape. With the tape recorder that I had, it was possible to record by hand winding the tape in record mode, to get a variable speed that I could use to do some interesting things. I used to amplify small objects on an apple box or on the wall, and I used the bathtub for reverberation and cardboard tubes as filters. I'd put microphones in the tube and then record sounds through the tube. So those were some of the early things that I did.</div>
