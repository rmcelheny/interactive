	Alien Bog<br><br>1967<br><br>
	As said in a 2003 public radio interview:<br><br>
	<div class="pauline"> "Alien Bog" I made at Mills in 1967, in the summer. This was the summer before I left for UCSD. The studio window opened out onto the pond right there on the campus--beautiful pond, it's still there, and it had a lots of interesting sounds coming out of it. I would listen to those sounds as I was making my music, and I made a whole series of pieces that had the word "bog" in the title. "Alien Bog" was the one that got on the Pogus CD, and I guess I felt that the sounds in "Alien Bog" were alien to the pond. That's how the title came about. I used the same delay system that I'm still using now for "Alien Bog" with the Buchla box at the same time.
