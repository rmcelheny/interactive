				<p> What is it like to produce a physical installation with an artist who works digitally?<a href=#answer>...</a></p>
			</div>

			<div class="travis" id="answer">
				<p>It varies. With every artist we show we try to have regular studio visits or conversations about how the show is progressing, but it's fluid. </p>
				<p>With Ann, who has had two shows at the gallery, she tells us what she's thinking about and we have a bit of a back and forth about it. <span style="background-color:yellow"> She has only been showing physical work since we've started working with her, while she's always done a lot of video and performance. So Anne wanted our input as the show was coming along because she wanted our expertise in installing physical works. </span></p>
				<p>But it depends on the artist<a href=#answer2>...</a></p>

			<div class="travis" id="answer2">
				<p>	<span style="background-color:yellow">When we opened the gallery, we wanted to offer digital artists a chance to show physical work when that's something they don't normally have the chance to do. </span>To offer them new ways of presenting and modeling, to push their practice a little bit outside of what normally would be possible. </p>
				<p>
				Jon was showing photographs and digital prints, but he hadn't shown sculpture really beyond something like a 3d print. So we were the first to offer that opportunity, and he was definitely excited to do so.</p>
				<p>
				But also with Jon and with Brenna, their physical work is a pysical realization of a digital environment. It's one-to-one, in a way. With Ann it's a bit less direct. </p>
