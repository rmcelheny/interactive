			<p> What is it like to produce a physical installation with an artist who works digitally?</p>
			<p class="travis">
				It varies. With every artist we show we try to have regular studio visits or conversations about how the show is progressing, but it's fluid. </p>
			<p class="travis">
			With Anne, who has had two shows at the gallery, she tells us what she's thinking about and we have a bit of a back and forth about it. She has only been showing physical work since we've started working with her, while she's always done a lot of video and performance. So Anne wanted our input as the show was coming along because she wanted our expertise in installing physical works. </p>

			<p class="travis">
			But it depends on the artist. </p>

			<p class="travis">
			When we opened the gallery, we wanted to offer digital artists a chance to show physical work when that's something they don't normally have the chance to do. To offer them mew ways of presenting and modeling, to push one's practice a little bit outside of what normally would be possible. </p>

			<p class="travis">
			Jon was showing photographs and digital prints, but he hadn't shown sculpture really beyond something like a 3d print. So we were the first to offer that opportunity, and he was definitely excited to do so. 
			</p>

			<p class="travis">
			But also with Jon and with Brenna, their physical work is a pysical realization of a digital environment. It's one-to-one, in a way. With Ann it's a bit less direct. </p>
