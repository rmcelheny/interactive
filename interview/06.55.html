			<p>You've produced projects of different lengths - the one-month residency, the pop-up show, a month-long show. How does the duration of the show affect the program?</p>
			<p class="travis">
			Definitely the context informs certain aspects of how we present or promote the exhibition or show. With residencies there's a matter of camaraderie that develops with us and the artist, and that definitely affects how a show comes together. But photos of the installation extend the project. </p>
			<p class="travis">
			We're less dependent on the circulation of images of our shows than we were when we were in Oregon, but we still rely on that. If it's a pop-up project or a one-night exhibition, what most people see is the documentation of it.</p>
			<p class="travis">
			But one of the nice things about having a physical space is that we can leave something up for the normal six weeks and give the show time. So it's more a response to the physical space of the gallery than to the speed of online space. Having a space and wanting to do a lot with it, but knowing we have it allows us to let it be and let it live. </p>
			<p class="travis">
			We were so used to doing a show a month every month for 9-10 months out of the year at Appendix, and each one would ential having somebody live with us for 3 weeks, so this seems pretty comfortable.
