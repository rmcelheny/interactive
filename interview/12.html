		<p>It's hard to say. I would say that my goal is to continue to expand our programming. To get more artists on the roster. We'd like to be more invigorated with one-night programing as well. Finishing the physical build-out of the backyard and basement, and making the building really special, that's a major goal. But those are all do-able, forseeable goals.</p>
		<p>A big goal is to have the gallery function as our main jobs, we all work elsewhere right now. We'd like to be doing well enough to bring in a fuller staff. A curatorial assistant and a registrar. Somebody to help with research. </p>
		<p>But the physical space is important to all of us. Providing a sanctuary. wanting the backyard to be some sort of breather kind of space, space to reflect.</p>
